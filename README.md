# InsomniTrack

My goal for this app is to allow a user to get an approximation of how long it takes them to fall asleep. It supposedly takes the average person 15 minutes to fall asleep (https://www.sleep.org/articles/how-long-to-fall-asleep/), so every 15 minutes a short vibration will happen. If the user is asleep and doesn't respond after 30 seconds, the app will assume the user is asleep and logs approximately how long it took the user to fall asleep. If the user does respond, the timer restarts.
